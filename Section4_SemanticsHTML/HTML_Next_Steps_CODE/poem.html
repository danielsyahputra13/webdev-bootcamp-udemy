    <p>
        The plates will still shift <br>
        and the clouds will still spew.<br>
        The sun will slowly rise<br>
        and the moon will follow too.<br>
        Lifeâ€™s beauty will continue<br>
        to flourish all around,<br>
        but now you are gone,<br>
        these birds have no sound.<br>
        And my heart does not beat.<br>
        It is still inside my chest.<br>
        My tears keep on falling<br>
        and my head will not rest.<br>
        But I have no choice only<br>
        to move through this life.<br>
        Endlessly attempting<br>
        to fill this longing that is rife<br>
