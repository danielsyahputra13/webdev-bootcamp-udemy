    <h1>Wolf</h1>
    <p>
        The <strong>wolf</strong> (Canis lupus), also known as the <strong>gray wolf</strong> or <strong>grey wolf</strong>, 
        is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, 
        and gray wolves, as colloquially understood, comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
        The English "wolf" stems from the Old English wulf, 
        which is itself thought to be derived from the Proto-Germanic *wulfaz. 
        The Proto-Indo-European root *wĺ̥kʷos may also be the source of the Latin word for the animal lupus (*lúkʷos).
        The name "gray wolf" refers to the grayish colour of the species.
